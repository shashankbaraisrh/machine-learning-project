# code
a good github repo always tries to document the functionality of the project in a readme file. a typical readme should contain:
-   a brief description of the project (3-4 lines)
-   all technical pre-requisites needed to compile and run the code
-   if one wishes to contribute to the code , then how to create a local dev environment and contribution guidelines.
